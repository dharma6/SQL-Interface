## SQL-Interface

### Motivation
This Project was developed as a part of course requirement Database Management systems in our Master's Degree.

### About :
Developed a graphical user interface to compare insertion techniques like Single Insertion, Multi line Insertion, Load Data Insertion with various datasets.  

The UI will represent successful and failure execution of the query.

### Analysis: 
An analysis was made using various charts on the performance of bulk loading vs single insertion.

### Technology Stack
PHP and MySql work bench

### Project Deliverable:

A scalability analysis involving different functions (joining, sorting, averaging, etc.). There should be analyses on at least 5 different functions. In each analysis, choose 3 dataset sizes to test on. You will need to create these datasets. The minimum dataset size should be 100,000. Report the times it took to execute these functions for these different datasets. Create appropriate charts to show your analysis.


### Result
Successfully delivered the prooject.
